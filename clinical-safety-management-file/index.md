## Clinical Safety

### Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC)

* DTAC is a UK(England)-only grouping of assessment criteria. It is relatively new, and aims to simply bring together and harmonise _existing_ assessment criteria for digital technologies. More information is available on [the NHSX website](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-technology-assessment-criteria-dtac/)

* DTAC incorporates the DCB0129 and DCB0160 standards for clinical safety, which the {{ project_name }} is compliant with.

### DCB0129 and DCB0160 Compliance

### Hazard Logs

Our Hazard Logs are managed on GitHub in the open. Details of how this works are [here](hazard-log.md).

## Downloading this documentation as a PDF

We have prepared this documentation using the tools of the modern Web (MarkDown, static HTML site generation) in order to present a linkable, searchable, interactive documentation site which is version controlled using Git and is openly available.

We are aware that some organisations may wish to download a 'simulated paper' document such as a PDF, and for this reason we have set up the site to automatically generate a PDF version of the entire documentation, which can be downloaded [here](./download.md)
