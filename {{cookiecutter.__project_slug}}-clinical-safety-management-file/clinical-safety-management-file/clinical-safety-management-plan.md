### Clinical Risk Meetings

### Issue tracking

## Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management Deliverables

### Clinical Risk Management File (this repository)

The {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} will establish a Clinical Risk Management File (CRMF) for each safety related Healthcare IT system. The purpose of the CRMF is toprovide a central repository where all safety related information pertaining to the Healthcare IT system is stored and controlled. This GitHub repository contains out Clinical Risk Management File.

### Clinical Risk Management Plan (this document)

The {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} will establish a Clinical Risk Management Plan (CRMP) for each safety related Healthcare IT system. The purpose of the CRMP is to identify the clinical risk management activities that are to be undertaken and the phasing of these activities in the project lifecycle.

The CRMP will also identify the resources required to discharge these clinical risk management activities.

### Hazard Log

The {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} will establish and maintain a Hazard Log (HL) for each safety related Healthcare IT system. The HL will be controlled and configured in accordance with the Organisation document control /quality management policy \[provide a reference\].

### Clinical Safety Case

The {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} will establish and develop a Clinical Safety Case (CSC) for each safety-related Healthcare IT system:

- item
- item
- item

### Clinical Safety Case Report

The {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} will issue a Clinical Safety Case Report (CSCR) for each safety related Healthcare IT system. The CSCR will be issued to support initial deployment and will be updated during the lifecycle of the Healthcare IT system should the safety characteristics change. The CSCR will be controlled and configured in accordance with the Organisation’s document control policy \[provide a reference\]. The HL will be made available within the CRMF.

## Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management Activities

### Hazard Identification

The {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} will conduct hazard identification workshops to identify potential hazards associated with the deployment and use of our Healthcare IT system. The [Clinical Safety Officer](#clinical-safety-officer) will be responsible for facilitating such workshops and ensuring attendance from the {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }}. Typically, representatives from the following domains will be required:

- Technical testing team

- User research and User Experience team

- Clinical testing team

- Statistical support

- Project Board

The workshops will have minutes taken and a copy stored in the [Clinical Risk Management File](#clinical-risk-management-file).

If a Healthcare IT solution is deemed not to be safety related then this decision will be formally recorded.

The technical team will advise on the best mechanism for addition of new issues to the the {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }}'s project management workflow.

Where any third-party components are used to support the Healthcare IT system then they will be considered in the scope of the hazard identification activities and subsequent risk assessment. Where none areused a positive declaration to this effect will be recorded in the minutes.

All identified hazards will be recorded in the Hazard Log.

### Risk Assessment

the {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }}'s Health will conduct Healthcare IT system risk assessment in accordance with the Risk Management Strategy. The Hazard Log will be updated to capture the risk assessment.

### Risk Evaluation

The {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} will conduct Healthcare IT system risk evaluation inaccordance with the Risk Management Strategy. The Hazard Log will be updated to capture the risk evaluation.

### Risk Control

Where the initial risk evaluation is deemed unacceptable, further risk controls will be required. the {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} will manage Healthcare IT system risk in accordance with the Risk Management Strategy.

Details of the risk control measure and evidence of effective implementation will be captured in the Hazard Log.

### Deployment and Ongoing Maintenance

To support clinical safety activities undertaken during any deployment phases of a project or programme of work the following documentation will be required to form a part of the overall approval process.

### Incident Management

Clinical Risk Management activities within the Organisation and theHealthcare IT programmes and services offered are completed within the corporate risk management strategy. As such, clinical safety related incidents are dealt with in a similar manner as other incidents within the organisational such as financial,reputational, technical and other service impacting categories.

### Safety Incident Management Process

### Security Incident Management Process

Security issues may be responsibly disclosed to [{{ cookiecutter.security_responsible_disclosure_email }}]({{ cookiecutter.security_responsible_disclosure_email }}) for immediate action. We recognise and respect the essential work of security researchers and will treat your contribution with gratitude and appropriate action. We do not engage in vexatious Computer Misuse Act litigation.

Internally we treat security issues with the highest priority. Once the 'acute phase' of any security threat is handled, we will then follow the Safety Incident Management Process, usually converting to a public GitHub Issue.

## Clinical Safety Competence and Training

### Overview

The clinical safety activities described in this Clinical Risk Management System shall be undertaken by competent staff. Suitable training shall be undertaken by staff to maintain and expand their level of competence.

### Competency

All of the staff identified in the organisation chart, shall be sufficiently competent for the roles and tasks which they are asked to undertake. Where an individual does not yet have sufficient experience or knowledge, then that person shall be monitored, and his/her work reviewed, by someone who has the necessary competence. Such supervision shall prevail until it is judged that the individual has amassed the necessary experience to undertake such tasks unsupervised.

In assessing competency, the different functional roles required to fully discharge the obligations of the Clinical Risk Management System,and the necessary skills and knowledge needed for each, shall be considered. Primary functional roles may include: - Conducting discrete safety analyses (for example, a HAZOP or FFA) or defining the Hazard Risk Indicators for a particular project.

- Making a valid judgement on the safety tasks, activities and techniques required for a given Health Software Product in order to justify the comprehensiveness and completeness of the safety assessment and produce the safety argument with supporting evidence.

- Assurance of safety assessments and Healthcare IT software products. Performance of safety techniques and development of the safety argument for a particular Healthcare IT software product must be independent to any assurance activities for the same.

- Improving and refining the overall Clinical Risk Management System, for example, audit, process change, quality.

- Ownership and leadership, for example, ultimate safety accountability, culture change, influencing and strategic direction.

- The first test in establishing competency shall be at the interview stage where potential staff shall be assessed against the above representative roles and agreed job descriptions. Thereafter, competence shall be monitored through the organisation’s established appraisal scheme. Any perceived deficiencies identified during the course of the work or at the appraised stage, especially during probation, shall be addressed immediately, for example, through the assignment of a competent supervisor or the provision of suitable training.

- All registered clinicians involved in safety roles shall, as a minimum,have completed an accredited training course.

### Training

- As part of the employment process and thereafter through the appraisal scheme, clinical safety personnel will undergo suitable training to develop, maintain or enhance their competency level. Such training can comprise: - ‘on the job’ training conducted under supervision - Internal training courses - Approved external training courses.

- All registered clinicians involved in clinical safety roles shall, as a minimum, have completed an accredited training course.

- Completion of any safety training shall be recorded by the individual on the annual appraisal form.

## Audits

### Overview

Audits shall be undertaken to ensure that projects are adhering to thedefined safety requirements. Such audits will focus on the **ClinicalSafety Team** and **third-party** suppliers.

### Internal Safety Audits

- the {{ cookiecutter.clinical_safety_team_name }} shall undertake regular internal safety audits to ensure that projects undertaken within the organisation are compliant with this Clinical Risk Management System. These audits shall be conducted and recorded in accordance with the internal quality management procedure.

- The scope of an internal safety audit will be the formal Clinical Risk Management System and the Organisation’s documentation supporting this document.
